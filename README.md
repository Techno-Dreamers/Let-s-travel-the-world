## What is this project for?

This project is an educative game that will enable everyone, especially tourists of different ages to learn about traditions and customs of Medvegja, Presheva and Bujanovac. They will have the opportunity to be entertained by playing with turtles, doing quizzes and puzzles.

## How to play?

To play simply launch main.py, click "Start" and choose one of the three cities. Read the information for the first 10-30 seconds and then the game will start playing automatically. You should move the blue turtle using the arrow keys in order to catch the black turtle. You have to catch as much points as "Goal" specifies within the time limit which you can see at the top left to pass the level. If you fail the level you can repeat it or answer a quiz.
